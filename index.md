## Welcome to the Temple University Coding Outreach Group (COG)

This group is a resource for people in various fields, and at various training levels, who wish to strengthen their coding skills.

COG "Office Hours" will be held on Thursdays from 3:30-5:30PM. Office hours are meant to serve as an open environment where people can come to work on personal coding and computational projects and get help from other attendees (as opposed to traditional office hours). If you are interested, please join the COG Google Group (link here)[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/coding-outreach-group/join]

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Temple-Coding-Oureach-Group/tu-cog.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
